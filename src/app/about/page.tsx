        Founded by two friends with a shared dream and a deep passion for fashion, <strong>Runvay</strong> was
        created to inspire individuals to express themselves boldly through what they wear. We're not just selling
        clothes — we're building confidence, attitude, and identity through fashion.

        The name <strong>Runvay</strong> is a unique blend of <em>“Run”</em> and <em>“Way”</em>, symbolizing your personal journey in style.
        To us, Runvay means <strong>"running your own way"</strong> — carving your path, owning your choices, and doing it all in style.
        It’s about moving forward, breaking norms, and expressing your vibe through every outfit.

        wear your confidence out loud. From minimalist staples to statement pieces, every design at Runvay is crafted
        to make you feel empowered, unique, and ready for any moment.
